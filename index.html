<p>The official <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> IRC channel, on the <a class="reference external" href="https://libera.chat/">Libera</a> network.</p>
<p><span class="docutils literal">#python</span> is a channel for discussing the Python programming language. People
of all skill levels are welcome to participate.</p>
<p>Please don't paste into the channel! Use a pastebin service such as

<h1>What happened to Freenode?</h1>
<p>Freenode came under new management in May 2021.  The new staff did not share
our values, acted unilaterally to replace Freenode staff and policies, and aggressively
displaced channel operators.
The new Freenode staff includes people we know to be disruptive to productive communities.
Libera is run by the old Freenode staff we had come to trust over years of cooperation.

the <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/joepie91/df80d8d36cd9d1bde46ba018af497409">The Freenode resignation FAQ</a>
provides background.</p>

<h1>Guidelines</h1>

<p>To ensure that everyone has a pleasant experience, we ask that participants
take these guidelines to heart:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Follow the Python Software Foundation's <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/">Code of Conduct</a>. We want people
to be kind, respectful and considerate. <span class="docutils literal">#python</span> is a place for everyone
to learn about Python.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid strong or sexual language. People from all ages, nationalities and
cultures use <span class="docutils literal">#python</span>, so please keep the language and demeanor
acceptable to all.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to keep the discussion on-topic. <span class="docutils literal">#python</span> is not a social chat
channel; it is a technical help channel. Off-topic discussions can be moved
to <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#python-offtopic</span></span> or another channel.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume best intentions. People are in <span class="docutils literal">#python</span> because they want to
learn about Python, or because they want to help others with Python.</p></li>
</ul>
